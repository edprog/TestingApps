# TestingApps
Miscelaneus work using Angular JS, Masonry and Bootstrap.


1) Download the program
2) Open it using Visual Studio 2013 or similar
3) The website should come up when load it from http://localhost:[port]/, otherwise http://localhost:[port]/index.html

# Additional Notes

This application was built using the following tools:
    - Bootstrap
	- Masonry
	- Angular JS
	
It is responsive and masonry works well with it.

# Issues to look into

The images are first rendered for a second and then masonry picks it up to accommodate the thumbnails, researched and it seems there
is a work around by integrating a callback. Will implement in the near feature.
